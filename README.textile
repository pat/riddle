This client has been written to interface with "Sphinx":http://sphinxsearch.com/. It is written by "Pat Allan":http://freelancing-gods.com, and has been influenced by both Dmytro Shteflyuk's Ruby client and the original PHP client - credit where credit's due, after all.

It does not follow the same syntax as those two, though (not much point writing this otherwise) - opting for a more Ruby-like structure.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>sudo gem install riddle</code></pre>

h3. Usage

As of version 1.0.0, Riddle now supports multiple versions of Sphinx in the one gem - you'll need to require your specific version after a normal require, though.

<pre><code>require 'riddle'
require 'riddle/0.9.9'</code></pre>

To get started, just instantiate a Client object:

<pre><code>client = Riddle::Client.new # defaults to localhost and port 9312
client = Riddle::Client.new "sphinxserver.domain.tld", 3333 # custom settings</code></pre>

And then set the parameters to what you want, before running a query:

<pre><code>client.match_mode = :extended
client.query "Pat Allan @state Victoria"</code></pre>

The results from a query are similar to the other clients - but here's the details. It's a hash with
the following keys:

* @:matches@
* @:fields@
* @:attributes@
* @:attribute_names@
* @:words@
* @:total@
* @:total_found@
* @:time@
* @:status@
* @:warning@ (if appropriate)
* @:error@ (if appropriate)

The key @:matches@ returns an array of hashes - the actual search results. Each hash has the document id (@:doc@), the result weighting (@:weight@), and a hash of the attributes for the document (@:attributes@).

The @:fields@ and @:attribute_names@ keys return list of fields and attributes for the documents. The key @:attributes@ will return a hash of attribute name and type pairs, and @:words@ returns a hash of hashes representing the words from the search, with the number of documents and hits for each, along the lines of:

<pre><code>results[:words]["Pat"] #=> {:docs => 12, :hits => 15}</code></pre>

@:total@, @:total_found@ and @:time@ return the number of matches available, the
total number of matches (which may be greater than the maximum available), and the time in milliseconds that the query took to run.

@:status@ is the error code for the query - and if there was a related warning, it will be under the @:warning@ key. Fatal errors will be described under @:error@.

If you've installed the gem and wondering why there's no tests - check out the git version. I've kept the specs out of the gem as I have a decent amount of test data in there, which really isn't needed unless you want to submit patches.
