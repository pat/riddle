h1. Riddle

This client has been written to interface with "Sphinx":http://sphinxsearch.com/. It is written by
"Pat Allan":http://freelancing-gods.com, and has been influenced by both Dmytro Shteflyuk's Ruby
client and the original PHP client - credit where credit's due, after all.

It does not follow the same syntax as those two, though (not much point writing this otherwise) -
opting for a more Ruby-like structure.

h2. Installation

  sudo gem install riddle --source http://gemcutter.org

h3. Usage

As of version 1.0.0, Riddle now supports multiple versions of Sphinx in the one gem - you'll need to require your specific version after a normal require, though.

  require 'riddle'
  require 'riddle/0.9.9'

To get started, just instantiate a Client object:

  client = Riddle::Client.new # defaults to localhost and port 3312
  client = Riddle::Client.new "sphinxserver.domain.tld", 3333 # custom settings
  
And then set the parameters to what you want, before running a query:

  client.match_mode = :extended
  client.query "Pat Allan @state Victoria"
  
The results from a query are similar to the other clients - but here's the details. It's a hash with
the following keys:

* :matches
* :fields
* :attributes
* :attribute_names
* :words
* :total
* :total_found
* :time
* :status
* :warning (if appropriate)
* :error (if appropriate)

The key @:matches@ returns an array of hashes - the actual search results. Each hash has the
document id (@:doc@), the result weighting (@:weight@), and a hash of the attributes for
the document (@:attributes@).

The @:fields@ and @:attribute_names@ keys return list of fields and attributes for the
documents. The key @:attributes@ will return a hash of attribute name and type pairs, and
@:words@ returns a hash of hashes representing the words from the search, with the number of
documents and hits for each, along the lines of:

  results[:words]["Pat"] #=> {:docs => 12, :hits => 15}
  
@:total@, @:total_found@ and @:time@ return the number of matches available, the
total number of matches (which may be greater than the maximum available), and the time in milliseconds
that the query took to run.

@:status@ is the error code for the query - and if there was a related warning, it will be under
the @:warning@ key. Fatal errors will be described under @:error@.

If you've installed the gem and wondering why there's no tests - check out the svn version. I've kept the specs out of the gem as I have a decent amount of test data in there, which really isn't needed unless you want to submit patches.
