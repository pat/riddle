h1. Widdle

This client has been hacked out of "Riddle":https://github.com/freelancing-god/riddle by implementing a new SphinxQL-only interface and discarding the deprecated Sphinx binary API code. It's based directly on the native "Mysql2":https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2 with all the associated benefits.

Widdle is in development and may or may not retain the configuration features from Riddle.  Feedback appreciated or fork away if you need it sooner.

h2. Installation

  git clone https://github.com/tribalvibes/widdle
